        <h1>Miyuni Muthunima Katugampala</h1>
        <p>I'm Miyuni Muthunima Katugampala, a dedicated software engineering student with a passion for developing innovative solutions and building efficient, user-centered applications. With a solid foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and constantly seek out new learning opportunities to expand my technical skills.<br>

            My journey in tech began with a fascination for how things work, which naturally led me to explore the field of software development. Now, I'm focused on honing my skills in full-stack development, algorithms, and data structures, with projects that challenge me to think critically and creatively.<br>
            
            Beyond technical skills, I value collaboration and teamwork, as I believe the best solutions come from diverse ideas and perspectives. I've had the opportunity to work on group projects, where I not only improved my coding abilities but also learned the importance of effective communication and project management.<br>
            
            Currently, I'm exploring areas like cloud computing, machine learning, and mobile app development, aiming to build a versatile skill set that can adapt to the ever-evolving tech landscape. I'm excited to apply my skills in internships and collaborative projects, and I look forward to contributing positively to the tech industry.<br>
            
            In my free time, you'll find me exploring open-source projects, diving into tech blogs, or experimenting with new programming tools and frameworks. If you're looking for a tech enthusiast who's eager to learn, adapt, and create impactful solutions, I'd love to connect!<br>
